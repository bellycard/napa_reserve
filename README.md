napa_reserve
============

This repo is just a placeholder for what will eventually become a tool that hooks into Travis and reports warnings about code issues with Napa services. These code issues might be things like: running an old version of Napa or maybe some other convention that has changed. These checks will evolve over time, so this repo will be the place where the checks are maintained and versioned.
